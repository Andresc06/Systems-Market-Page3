# Webpage 3 (Systems Marketplace)

## Link: https://systems-market-page3.netlify.app/

It is a WebPage called "Systems Market place" where I used different JS libraries. Here, I recommend a series of technology stuff like laptops, which I consider popular brands such as Lenovo, Apple, ASUS, and Hp. Also, I talk about 4 of the most relevant software from my point of view as a technology lover and different accessories for Gaming and hardware components from Desktop Computers. 

It is the 3rd page I made, using my knowledge in **Front-End Developing** that I took in my years of study at the University and different Online Certifications from Coursera, Udemy, and FreeCodeCamp.

I employ the following technologies in the WebPage:

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Bootstrap**
* **JavaScript**
