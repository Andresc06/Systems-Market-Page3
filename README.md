# Webpage 3 (Systems Marketplace)
This is a WebPage called "Systems Marketplace" where I used differents JS libraries. It is a webpage where I recommend a series of laptops, considering popular brands such as Lenovo, Apple, ASUS, and Hp. In addition, I recommend 4 of the most important software from my view, and different acccesories for Gaming and hardware components from Desktop Computers. This is my 3rd page I made, using my knowledge in **Front-End Developing** that I took in my years of study at the University and different Online Certification of Coursera, Udemy, and FreeCodeCamp.

I employ the following technologies in the WebPage:

* **Jquery**
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Bootstrap**
* **JavaScript**
